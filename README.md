============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LibraryOfCongress/bagit-python.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/LibraryOfCongress/bagit-python)

bagit is a Python library and command line utility for working with  [BagIt](http://purl.org/net/bagit) style packages.

Installation
------------

bagit.py is a single-file python module that you can drop into your project as 
needed or you can install globally with:

    pip install bagit

Python v2.6+ is required.

Command Line Usage
------------------

When you install bagit you should get a command line program called bagit.py
which you can use to turn an existing directory into a bag:

    bagit.py --contact-name 'John Kunze' /directory/to/bag

You can pass in key/value metadata for the bag using options like 
`--contact-name` above, which get persisted to the bag-info.txt. For a 
complete list of bag-info.txt properties you can use as commmand line
arguments see `--help`.

Since calculating checksums can take a while when creating a bag, you may want 
to calculate them in parallel if you are on a multicore machine. You can do 
that with the `--processes` option:

    bagit.py --processes 4 /directory/to/bag

To specify which checksum algorithm(s) to use when generating the manifest,
use the --md5, --sha1, --sha256 and/or --sha512 flags (MD5 is generated by default).

    bagit.py --sha1 /path/to/bag
    bagit.py --sha256 /path/to/bag
    bagit.py --sha512 /path/to/bag

If you would like to validate a bag you can use the --validate flag.

    bagit.py --validate /path/to/bag

If you would like to take a quick look at the bag to see if it seems valid
by just examining the structure of the bag, and comparing its payload-oxum (byte
count and number of files) then use the `--fast` flag.

    bagit.py --validate --fast /path/to/bag

And finally, if you'd like to parallelize validation to take advantage of
multiple CPUs you can:

    bagit.py --validate --processes 4 /path/to/bag

Library Usage
-------------

You can also use bagit programatically in your own Python programs. 

### Create

To create a bag you would do this:

```python
bag = bagit.make_bag('mydir', {'Contact-Name': 'John Kunze'})
```

`make_bag` returns a Bag instance. If you have a bag already on disk and would
like to create a Bag instance for it, simply call the constructor directly:

```python
bag = bagit.Bag('/path/to/bag')
```

### Update Bag Metadata

You can change the metadata persisted to the bag-info.txt by using the `info`
property on a `Bag`.

```python
# load the bag
bag = bagit.Bag('/path/to/bag')

# update bag info metadata
bag.info['Internal-Sender-Description'] = 'Updated on 2014-06-28.'
bag.info['Authors'] = ['John Kunze', 'Andy Boyko']
bag.save()
```

### Update Bag Manifests

By default `save` will not update manifests. This guards against a situation
where a call to `save` to persist bag metadata accidentally regenerates
manifests for an invalid bag. If you have modified the payload of a bag by 
adding, modifying or deleting files in the data directory, and wish to
regenerate the manifests set the `manifests` parameter to True when calling
`save`.

```python

import shutil, os

# add a file
shutil.copyfile('newfile', '/path/to/bag/data/newfile')

# remove a file
os.remove('/path/to/bag/data/file')

# persist changes
bag.save(manifests=True)
```

The save method takes an optional processes parameter which will 
determine how many processes are used to regenerate the checksums.
This can be handy on multicore machines.

### Validation

If you would like to see if a bag is valid, use its `is_valid` method:

```python
bag = bagit.Bag('/path/to/bag')
if bag.is_valid():
    print "yay :)"
else:
    print "boo :("
```

If you'd like to get a detailed list of validation errors, 
execute the `validate` method and catch the `BagValidationError` 
exception. If the bag's manifest was invalid (and it wasn't caught by the 
payload oxum) the exception's `details` property will contain a list of 
`ManifestError`s that you can introspect on. Each ManifestError, will be of 
type `ChecksumMismatch`, `FileMissing`, `UnexpectedFile`.

So for example if you want to print out checksums that failed to validate 
you can do this:

```python

bag = bagit.Bag("/path/to/bag")

try:
  bag.validate()

except bagit.BagValidationError, e:
  for d in e.details:
    if isinstance(d, bag.ChecksumMismatch):
      print "expected %s to have %s checksum of %s but found %s" % \
        (e.path, e.algorithm, e.expected, e.found)
```

To iterate through a bag's manifest and retrieve checksums for the payload 
files use the bag's entries dictionary:

```python
bag = bagit.Bag("/path/to/bag")

for path, fixity in bag.entries.items():
  print "path:%s md5:%s" % (path, fixity["md5"])
```

Development
-----------

    % git clone git://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/bagit-python.git
    % cd bagit-python
    % python test.py

If you'd like to see how increasing parallelization of bag creation on 
your system effects the time to create a bag try using the included bench 
utility:

    % ./bench.py
