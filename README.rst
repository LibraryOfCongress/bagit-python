bagit is a Python library and command line utility for working with
`BagIt <http://purl.org/net/bagit>`__ style packages.

Installation
------------

bagit.py is a single-file python module that you can drop into your
project as needed or you can install globally with:

::

    pip install bagit

Python v2.6+ is required.

Command Line Usage
------------------

When you install bagit you should get a command-line program called
bagit.py which you can use to turn an existing directory into a bag:

::

    bagit.py --contact-name 'John Kunze' /directory/to/bag

Finding Bagit on your system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``bagit.py`` program should be available in your normal command-line
window (Terminal on OS X, Command Prompt or Powershell on Windows,
etc.). If you are unsure where it was installed you can also request
that Python search for ``bagit`` as a Python module: simply replace
``bagit.py`` with ``python -m bagit``:

::

    python -m bagit --help

On some systems Python may have been installed as ``python3``, ``py``,
etc. – simply use the same name you use to start an interactive Python
shell:

::

    py -m bagit --help
    python3 -m bagit --help

Configuring BagIt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can pass in key/value metadata for the bag using options like
``--contact-name`` above, which get persisted to the bag-info.txt. For a
complete list of bag-info.txt properties you can use as commmand line
arguments see ``--help``.

Since calculating checksums can take a while when creating a bag, you
may want to calculate them in parallel if you are on a multicore
machine. You can do that with the ``--processes`` option:

::

    bagit.py --processes 4 /directory/to/bag

To specify which checksum algorithm(s) to use when generating the
manifest, use the --md5, --sha1, --sha256 and/or --sha512 flags (MD5 is
generated by default).

::

    bagit.py --sha1 /path/to/bag
    bagit.py --sha256 /path/to/bag
    bagit.py --sha512 /path/to/bag

If you would like to validate a bag you can use the --validate flag.

::

    bagit.py --validate /path/to/bag

If you would like to take a quick look at the bag to see if it seems
valid by just examining the structure of the bag, and comparing its
payload-oxum (byte count and number of files) then use the ``--fast``
flag.

::

    bagit.py --validate --fast /path/to/bag

And finally, if you'd like to parallelize validation to take advantage
of multiple CPUs you can:

::

    bagit.py --validate --processes 4 /path/to/bag

Using BagIt in your programs
----------------------------

You can also use BagIt programatically in your own Python programs by
importing the ``bagit`` module.

Create
~~~~~~

To create a bag you would do this:

.. code:: python

    bag = bagit.make_bag('mydir', {'Contact-Name': 'John Kunze'})

``make_bag`` returns a Bag instance. If you have a bag already on disk
and would like to create a Bag instance for it, simply call the
constructor directly:

.. code:: python

    bag = bagit.Bag('/path/to/bag')

Update Bag Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can change the metadata persisted to the bag-info.txt by using the
``info`` property on a ``Bag``.

.. code:: python

    # load the bag
    bag = bagit.Bag('/path/to/bag')

    # update bag info metadata
    bag.info['Internal-Sender-Description'] = 'Updated on 2014-06-28.'
    bag.info['Authors'] = ['John Kunze', 'Andy Boyko']
    bag.save()

Update Bag Manifests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default ``save`` will not update manifests. This guards against a
situation where a call to ``save`` to persist bag metadata accidentally
regenerates manifests for an invalid bag. If you have modified the
payload of a bag by adding, modifying or deleting files in the data
directory, and wish to regenerate the manifests set the ``manifests``
parameter to True when calling ``save``.

.. code:: python


    import shutil, os

    # add a file
    shutil.copyfile('newfile', '/path/to/bag/data/newfile')

    # remove a file
    os.remove('/path/to/bag/data/file')

    # persist changes
    bag.save(manifests=True)

The save method takes an optional processes parameter which will
determine how many processes are used to regenerate the checksums. This
can be handy on multicore machines.

Validation
~~~~~~~~~~

If you would like to see if a bag is valid, use its ``is_valid`` method:

.. code:: python

    bag = bagit.Bag('/path/to/bag')
    if bag.is_valid():
        print("yay :)")
    else:
        print("boo :(")

If you'd like to get a detailed list of validation errors, execute the
``validate`` method and catch the ``BagValidationError`` exception. If
the bag's manifest was invalid (and it wasn't caught by the payload
oxum) the exception's ``details`` property will contain a list of
``ManifestError``\ s that you can introspect on. Each ManifestError,
will be of type ``ChecksumMismatch``, ``FileMissing``,
``UnexpectedFile``.

So for example if you want to print out checksums that failed to
validate you can do this:

.. code:: python


    bag = bagit.Bag("/path/to/bag")

    try:
      bag.validate()

    except bagit.BagValidationError as e:
        for d in e.details:
            if isinstance(d, bagit.ChecksumMismatch):
                print("expected %s to have %s checksum of %s but found %s" %
                      (d.path, d.algorithm, d.expected, d.found))

To iterate through a bag's manifest and retrieve checksums for the
payload files use the bag's entries dictionary:

.. code:: python

    bag = bagit.Bag("/path/to/bag")

    for path, fixity in bag.entries.items():
      print("path:%s md5:%s" % (path, fixity["md5"]))

Contributing to bagit-python development
----------------------------------------

::

    % git clone git://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/bagit-python.git
    % cd bagit-python
    # MAKE CHANGES
    % python test.py

Running the tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can quickly run the tests by having setuptools install dependencies:

::

    python setup.py test

Once your code is working, you can use
`Tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io/>`__ to run the tests with every
supported version of Python which you have installed on the local
system:

::

    tox

If you have Docker installed, you can run the tests under Linux inside a
container:

::

    % docker build -t bagit:latest . && docker run -it bagit:latest

Benchmarks
----------

If you'd like to see how increasing parallelization of bag creation on
your system effects the time to create a bag try using the included
bench utility:

::

    % ./bench.py
